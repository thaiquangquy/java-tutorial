# Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help developers write maintainable, scalable, and reusable code by providing well-defined approaches to structuring software systems.

Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

1. **[Creational Patterns](creational/README.md)** – Focus on object creation mechanisms, enhancing flexibility and reuse.
2. **[Structural Patterns](structural/README.md)** – Deal with object composition, ensuring system parts work together efficiently.
3. **[Behavioral Patterns](behavioral/README.md)** – Define communication and responsibility assignment between objects.

Each category contains multiple patterns tailored to solving specific design challenges. Click the links above to explore each category in detail.
